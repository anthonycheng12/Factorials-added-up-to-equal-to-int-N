# Factorials-added-up-to-equal-to-int-N
The Ministry of Finance of Factoriland issued banknotes with face value n! factoridollars for every positive integer n > 1. Design a recursive algorithm that finds all ways to pay N factoridollars taking as an input a positive integer N. For example, 12 factoridollars can be payed as two 3! banknotes, 3! banknote and three 2! banknotes, or six 2! banknotes. If you write a pseudocode, supply it with an explanation of correctness.
